				<p>I wasn’t always interested in gardening, as a kid growing up I recall countless weekends my dad made me help him with various 
				projects around the house and garden; installing pavers, cutting back palm tree fronds, throwing out old junk, cleaning the pool of the never ending onslought of leaf debris and the dreaded 
				green waste collections where we spent what seemed like an age hauling whatever he cut and piling it out the front for verge collection.</p>
				<p>Looking back through some old pictures of my childhood home I found we had quite a nice garden which I can appreciate now but it seems 
				funny to me because at the time I didn’t really pay much notice or think much of it.
				I actually quite like the tropical look, perhaps because I've always lived in a more dry and arid environment and I also like being in 
				a forest with a canopy overhead and this would inspire me for my future project.</p>
				<p>The story of my evolution begins a few years ago, I was renovating my backyard which was extremely bare. There was no grass but instead a weird green synthetic ground like you 
				might find in a playground, the whole back garden bed area was just a weed mat covered in dirt and there was a 70's style fibro-cement fence.
				I set to work painting the fence a dark purple to make the space look larger and began populating the space with an assorment of plants, which as time moved on would continue to increase.</p>
				<p>I found I enjoyed the process of picking plants and working out where they would go. I liked to watch the plants develop and how the whole look of the garden evolved over time. Eventually I
				would invest a lot of time and effort into improving the garden and landscape and the backyard truly became my garden.</p>
