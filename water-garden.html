				<h2 class="h3-style">Water Garden</h2>
				<p>The vegetable garden was a success, but there was still a relatively desolate backyard which needed work and I now had the
				knowledge and confidence necessary to move forward with my next project.
				There was a paved corner in the backyard which I knew had the potential to become a tranquil sitting area. I removed some of 
				the pavers and installed a pond which I assure you was no small effort on my part. The water feature was already giving off
				a tropical garden feel so I figured I would expand upon this.</p>

				<p>Most tropical plants tend to need a lot of shade because theyâ€™ve adapted in an environment with many competing plants 
				towering over them. Because of this I knew I would need to establish a canopy of some sort, so I went ahead and strategically
				planted some palms, banana trees and magnolias. If you want a tropical or jungle look, it will appear more natural if you plant in high density as thats how 
				they grow in nature with each plant trying to reach for any light that reaches the canopy floor.</p>

				<p id="final">Conditions are still not ideal as it will take these trees some years to grow to the size needed to provide a good canopy 
				but at their current size they do provide decent shade. In winter and autumn the sun sets much lower in the sky creating more 
				shade in this part of the garden, but in summer it recieves a lot of sun, so to compensate I put some shade cloths over
				the most sensitive plants. I added rocks to the garden and used rockery garden design aspects because I like the look of the stones. Overall though a lot of progress has been made and I continue to work on and improve the garden to this day.</p>
