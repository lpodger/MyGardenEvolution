				<p>The initial vegetable garden consisted of two sad looking tomato plants and some poor sandy soil typical of our area. At the time I didn’t know
				anything about plants or soils or how the whole process came together, but the idea of actually having a productive vegetable garden grew on me and
				I quickly set to work clearing some land of weeds and putting together some rudimentary garden beds with some old bricks that were laying around.</p>

				<p>When I first purchased some seedlings from our local garden store the prospect of caring for them all seemed like a daunting prospect. My realisation 
				after setting them down that I had no idea what I was doing with my first thought being “How do I water a plant?” This was going to be a challenge. Fortunately, 
				there are a huge amount of resources out there and a few dozen articles later and hundreds of YouTube videos I was successfully growing all manner of organic vegetables.</p>

				<p>I upgraded the brick veggie patch into four raised beds and moved it into a part of the garden that received more sunlight which is important for a productive garden.
				The beds were filled using a form of hügelkultur which involves placing sticks and logs on the bottom and stacking them up and finishing with some soil on top. The result
				is a rich well-draining soil filled with organic matter which is critical for healthy plant growth.</p>
